            There was a <p> here but needed to deleted it even though it didn't
            cause any error while rendering. The error was:
                `No “p” element in scope but a “p” end tag seen.`
            I have learned that it cannot contain block-level element like <ul>
            in this case. So simply removing the <p> element is enough.
